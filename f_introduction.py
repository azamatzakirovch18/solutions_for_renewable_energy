    This project is based on Global Renewable energy and includes 10 countries. There are 56 columns for representation.
    I divided then into 4 groups for analysing. They are :
    - Renewable Energy Data
    - Socio-Economic Indicators:
    - Environmental Factors
    - Additional Features
    ### Most important columns
    - Year
    - Country
    - Type of Renewable Energy
    - Government Policies
    
    Those columns are one of the most important for analysing. I can seperate them between 2 years by type of energy. Private or Primary. 
    ### Problems & Solution
    During this project i used only 1 question "WHY?" and it is helped to me find a lot of problems and solution for problems !
